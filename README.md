# DSA Journey: From Scratch to Advanced üöÄ

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository contains solutions, notes, and implementations of various DSA problems and concepts using **C++**. The goal is to build a strong foundation in DSA, starting from basic concepts and progressing to advanced topics.

## üìö Content

This repository is structured in a way that makes it easy to follow the progression from beginner to advanced DSA concepts. Each section contains explanations, code implementations, and sample problems to practice.

### 1. **Getting Started**

-   Basic syntax in C++
-   Input/output operations
-   Control structures (loops, conditions)

### 2. **Basic Data Structures**

-   Arrays
-   Linked Lists
-   Stacks
-   Queues

### 3. **Advanced Data Structures**

-   Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
-   Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
-   Graphs (BFS, DFS, Topological Sort)
-   Hash Tables

### 4. **Algorithms**

-   Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
-   Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort)
-   Recursion and Backtracking
-   Dynamic Programming (DP)
-   Greedy Algorithms

### 5. **Complexity Analysis**

-   Time and Space Complexity
-   Big-O Notation, Big-Omega, Big-Theta

### 6. **Advanced Topics**

-   Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
-   Segment Trees
-   Trie
-   Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)
